# Kw Small Business Lead Triage

Scores inbound HubSpot leads by engagement signals, company fit, and urgency markers to produce a "call these 5 today" list with talking points, drafts the follow-ups, and blocks Calendar time. Use when the user asks to prioritize leads, who to call first, or about their pipeline.

# Lead Triage

## Quick start

Pull inbound leads from HubSpot, score them, and surface a ranked call list with talking points. Drafts follow-ups and proposes calendar slots - never sends or books without owner approval.

```
User: "prioritize my leads"
→ Pull contacts: lifecycle stage Lead or MQL, status ≠ Unqualified
→ Score each across engagement, company fit, urgency, recency
→ Return ranked list (size adapts to volume) with talking points
→ Offer to draft follow-ups and propose calendar slots
```

## Workflow

1. **Pull leads from HubSpot.** Fetch contacts with `lifecyclestage` = `Lead` or `MQL` and `hs_lead_status` ≠ `Unqualified`. Use the field list in [reference/hubspot-scoring.md](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/skills/knowledge-work/small-business/skills/lead-triage/reference/hubspot-scoring.md). If HubSpot is unavailable, stop: *"HubSpot is disconnected - connect it and try again."*

2. **Clarify if trigger is ambiguous.** If the user said only "pipeline" without a qualifier, ask: *"Quick pipeline overview (deal stages + total value) or prioritized call list?"* - then route accordingly. Do not score leads on a bare "pipeline."

3. **Score each lead.** Apply the four-dimension model in [reference/hubspot-scoring.md](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/skills/knowledge-work/small-business/skills/lead-triage/reference/hubspot-scoring.md):
   - **Engagement** - email replies, opens, site visits in HubSpot (last 30 days only)
   - **Company fit** - industry and employee count vs. owner's ICP (default: any industry, 1–50 employees)
   - **Urgency** - lead age, stage duration, notes containing "urgent / ASAP / deadline / budget approved"
   - **Recency penalty** - subtract points if last activity was &lt;24 hours ago (already touched today)

4. **Build the ranked list.** Sort descending by composite score. Adapt list size to volume:
   - ≤10 leads → show all
   - 11–30 leads → show top 5
   - >30 leads → show top 8

   For each lead: name, company, score, one-paragraph talking point, last activity summary. If engagement signals are all >30 days old, flag: *"Engagement signals are stale - approach as cold outreach."*

5. **Offer follow-up drafts.** Ask: *"Draft follow-ups for any of these?"* If yes, write one email per selected lead, matching the tone of their last outbound thread in Mail. Show draft; do not send.

6. **Offer calendar slots.** Ask: *"Propose call slots for any of these?"* If yes, check Calendar for open 30-minute windows in the next two business days (avoid slots with existing events ±15 min). Propose two options per lead. Do not create events - the owner books.

## Approval gates

- **Never send an email.** Draft only; owner sends from their inbox.
- **Never create calendar events.** Propose times; owner books.
- **Never change lifecycle stage or mark a lead Unqualified** unless the owner explicitly asks.
- **Never include `Customer` or `Evangelist` lifecycle contacts** in the lead list.
- **If zero leads match the filter**, explain why and offer to check what lifecycle stages are in use - do not fabricate a list.
