# Kw Small Business Month Heads Up

Runs on the 25th - shows the next 30-day cash-flow outlook and flags anything that needs attention before month-end. Accepts optional 30 or 60 day horizon.

The following is the complete skill definition that OpenComputer loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.
:::

Run the month-end heads-up. Pull forward-looking cash data and give the owner a clear "here's what the next 30 days look like" picture with specific things to watch.

Parse arguments:
- `--horizon` (default: `30`) - forecast window in days (`30` or `60`)

## Step 1 - Current cash position

Using the `cash-flow-snapshot` skill workflow:

1. Pull QuickBooks current cash and receivables balance.
2. Pull PayPal settled balance and pending payouts.
3. Combine for total available + incoming cash.

## Step 2 - Upcoming obligations

1. Pull recurring expenses from QuickBooks (payroll, subscriptions, rent/lease) due in the next 30 days.
2. Pull any outstanding invoices past due or due within 14 days.
3. Flag any payment that would push the balance below a comfortable buffer (default: &lt;$2,000 or owner's QB average monthly expense × 0.5).

## Step 3 - Cash-flow forecast

1. Project 30-day net cash: current balance + expected inflows − known obligations.
2. Identify the single tightest week (lowest projected balance).
3. Flag if any week projects negative.

## Step 4 - Two things to watch

Surface no more than two specific, actionable watches:
- Which invoice(s) to chase now
- Which expense(s) to defer or negotiate

Format as:

```
Month-End Heads Up - {current date}
Horizon: next {X} days

Cash today: ${amount}
Projected end-of-period: ${amount}
Tightest week: {date range} - projected ${amount}

TWO THINGS TO WATCH
1. {item} - {why it matters} - suggested action: {action}
2. {item} - {why it matters} - suggested action: {action}
```

## Connector failures

If QuickBooks is unreachable, stop - the cash forecast requires QB as the source of truth. If PayPal is missing, run the forecast from QB-only data and note "PayPal not connected - PayPal receivables excluded from forecast." Same for Stripe/Square if missing.

## Approval gates

- **Never initiate payments or send emails automatically.** Surface the data and actions for the owner to take.
- **Never project revenue that hasn't been confirmed in QB or PayPal.** Use conservative estimates only.

## Output

Present the formatted brief and offer to draft chase emails for any flagged overdue invoices.
